/* There are three ways for positioning in CSS */
/* 1. static : It is the default position in CSS Html instruction flows in this pattern */
/* 2. relative :  This is the positioning relative to supported positioning or you can say that it is relative to the static position or the supported positioning will be following the instructions and applying them relative to the static positioning */
/* 3. absolute : This is the positioniong where the current positioning will be looking at the nearest ancestor and then applying the instructions -------  IF there is no any position mentioned in the ancestor then there will be the applications of the CSS instructions relative to the top left corner of the browser */
/* 4. fixed : This is the type of the positioning where the applied CSS will remain fixed throughout the browser  */
